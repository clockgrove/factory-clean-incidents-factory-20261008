# Synthetic support-incident explorer

This is an empty application starter with a deterministic fictional dataset. The application architecture, API, frontend structure, and implementation are deliberately open.

The qualification environment uses Node.js 24. Run `npm run seed` from this directory to create `.runtime/incidents.json`. The generator requires no packages or network access. Every invocation produces the same bytes. See `data/FIELDS.md` for the record meanings.

Keep `data/generate.mjs` and `data/FIELDS.md` unchanged. The application must treat the generated dataset as read-only. Add application code, useful verification, and startup instructions as needed. The installed browser-verification tooling and its exact command will be documented in the shared execution environment before either route begins; this starter does not claim that a browser is already installed.

## Exact shared commands

Generate the supplied canonical data:

npm run seed

Run complete verification, including meaningful application HTTP and browser checks you add:

npm test

The baseline uses Node's built-in `node:test` runner (generic `node --test` discovery). Its immutable data prerequisite runs before the test suite and installs the exact pinned development tooling with package lifecycle scripts disabled when needed. Keep the seed, pretest and test script bodies unchanged; add application verification in locations the generic Node test runner discovers. The initial passing data/tooling prerequisite is a tooling/data prerequisite, not application acceptance. Preserve `scripts/prepare.mjs` and the two `data/*` sources. Add the app, its startup instructions and meaningful real HTTP/browser verification without replacing these checks. Choose application architecture, API, UI and work breakdown freely.

Declare and implement a local startup script for this exact command, then document the actual URL/port and shutdown procedure:

npm run start

## Installed browser environment

All arms use the same pinned Playwright 1.64.0 and sandbox-enabled headless Chromium 156.0.8078.4. The provided package lock pins the Node browser tooling. Before importing Playwright for browser tests, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` to the provided browser directory. Use `{channel:'chromium', headless:true, chromiumSandbox:true}`; never add `--no-sandbox` or relax controls to pass a test.

The qualification host exposes the real `qualification-chromium` executable through a dedicated read-only tool prefix on PATH. Locate its alias using `command -v qualification-chromium`; the alias directory contains no application or account data. The browser directory is `../browsers` and the local library directory is `../host-libs/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` relative to that alias directory. Resolve those local tooling paths dynamically; do not hardcode a contributor workspace path in application code. Pass that library directory as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in Chromium's explicit child environment, with `ALSA_CONFIG_PATH` pointing to `../host-libs/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`. Do not assume arbitrary inherited environment variables survive worker isolation. Browser profiles and temporary files belong under the current checkout's ignored `.runtime/`; an explicit relative `TMPDIR='.runtime/browser-tmp'` (also TMP/TEMP) avoids Chromium's Linux socket-path length limit while keeping files in that workspace. Create that directory before launch, preserve the current checkout as cwd, and close the browser and any owned HTTP server in finally blocks. The controller's later shared screenshot assessment uses its independently proved short alias, retained separately.

Run actual local HTTP requests and real browser interactions against your implemented backend. Include data/sort/filter/pagination/whole-result-summary/details/export correctness and the human Objective's saved-view, keyboard, responsive, loading, empty, genuine failure and retry journeys. Do not mock or replace responses, generate screenshots of an imagined app, or treat this browser prerequisite as proof of application acceptance. Tests and app-local screenshots may use ignored `.runtime/`; commit source/verification/startup instructions, not runtime profiles or node_modules. Report an exact environment limitation if a required operation remains unavailable.

The same dedicated tool prefix also provides this actual browser/HTTP prerequisite command, after the data/tooling prerequisite has installed Playwright:

qualification-browser-smoke

It starts and closes a tiny real loopback HTTP page and sandbox-enabled Chromium, records actual process identities/launch argv and closure under ignored `.runtime/`, and reports the receipt path. It verifies the installed browser environment; it never supplies the application's behavior, design, API or passing acceptance.

## Run the explorer

With Node.js 24, run `npm run pretest` to prepare the canonical dataset and pinned tooling, then `npm run start`. Open **http://127.0.0.1:3000**. The application binds only to loopback. Stop it with Ctrl+C; no external services are used.

Search is literal and case-insensitive. Checked values within a filter are alternatives; different filters apply together. Dates include both UTC calendar endpoints. Severity sorting uses critical, high, medium, low; ties use incident ID. The daily chart and three counts cover the entire matching result. Open an incident to see all fields, then return to the same results. Named views live in this browser's local storage. Saving an existing name replaces it. Export contains all matching records in the selected sort; CSV tags are JSON arrays, null resolved dates are empty cells, and all cells are quoted with doubled embedded quotes.

## Verify the application

Run this ordered sequence from the checkout:

```sh
npm run pretest
qualification-browser-smoke
npm test
```

`npm test` retains its own pretest prerequisite. The discovered tests check real HTTP filtering, inclusive dates, stable sorting, pagination, complete summaries, details and parsed CSV against the canonical dataset. Sandboxed Chromium checks saved views, keyboard focus, narrow layout, loading, empty results, connection failures and retry, overlapping query/detail requests and repeated pagination. A loopback forwarding server delays genuine backend responses or closes connections to exercise pending and failed requests without mocking responses. All test servers and the browser close in finally blocks. Browser smoke receipts and the browser test's mobile screenshot are retained under ignored `.runtime/`. The supplied browser alias must be on PATH; browser and library paths are resolved relative to it as described above.
